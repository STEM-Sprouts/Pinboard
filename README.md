## What is Pinboard?

Pinboard is a **browser-based, block-based coding environment** that lets students write real hardware code — without the setup friction. Built by [STEM Sprouts](https://stemsprouts.org), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and used in live classroom sessions to teach IoT and physical computing to beginners.

Think Scratch, but the code actually runs on your Arduino.

```
Drag blocks → See generated C/MicroPython → Flash to hardware → Watch it work
```

No IDE installs. No driver headaches. No "it works on my machine."

## ✨ Features

### 🧩 Block-Based Editor
Powered by [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly). Drag-and-drop blocks across 7 categories:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| **Structure** | `setup()`, `loop()`, boot events |
| **Pins** | Digital/analog read & write |
| **Control** | If/else, loops, delays |
| **Logic** | Comparisons, boolean operations |
| **Math** | Arithmetic, mapping, constraints |
| **Serial** | Print, println, serial monitor |
| **Variables** | Declare, set, get |

### 🔌 Hardware Modules
Add specialized sensor/actuator blocks without writing import boilerplate:

- 🌡️ **DHT11/DHT22** — Temperature & humidity
- 🔆 **Photoresistor** — Light sensing
- 🔘 **Button** — Digital input
- ⚙️ **Servo** — Position control
- *(more being added continuously)*

### 🖥️ Multi-Platform Support

| Platform | Language | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Arduino (Uno, Nano, Mega) | C/C++ | ✅ Stable |
| Raspberry Pi | MicroPython | ✅ Stable |
| ESP32 | C/C++ | 🔧 Coming soon |

Switch between platforms with a single click — the same blocks generate the correct language automatically.

### 🧪 In-Browser Emulator
Test your code **before touching hardware**. The emulator simulates sensor values and pin states directly in the browser. An improved emulator with richer hardware simulation is in active development — see **Pinboard 2.0** below.

### 🎓 Live Session Mode
Built for classrooms. Instructors generate a **join code** to start a live session. Students connect instantly — no accounts required. Sessions include:

- Real-time participant view
- **Breakout challenges** — groups divided by sensor type work on different problems simultaneously
- Session-scoped code sharing

### 📟 Arduino C Preview
Every block change instantly updates a live C/MicroPython preview at the bottom of the screen. Students see the real code their blocks produce — bridging visual and text-based programming.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Try it instantly
No install needed → **[pinboard.stemsprouts.org](https://pinboard.stemsprouts.org)**

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/STEM-Sprouts/pinboard.git
cd pinboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, npm 9+

### Flash to hardware
1. Build your program with blocks
2. Click **Enter Code** to switch to text mode (optional)
3. Click **Run** — Pinboard compiles and flashes over WebSerial
4. Watch the Serial Monitor for output

> **Note:** WebSerial requires Chrome or Edge. Firefox is not currently supported.

## 🏗️ Pinboard 2.0 — IR-based architecture (in progress)

Pinboard is being rebuilt around a single **intermediate representation (IR)** so the
code preview can never lie about what the simulator does:

```
Blockly workspace → Project document → IR → { simulator | Arduino C printer | compile check }
```

The architecture spec (spine, ordered build plan, and per-domain docs for the
runtime, codegen, hardware, persistence, and compiler subsystems) is maintained
as private planning docs and drives the phases below.

**Status: Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 in progress.**

Phase 0 — headless runtime spike (done):
- ✅ Canonical IR types (`src/ir/`) and audited Arduino Uno board profile (`src/hardware/`)
- ✅ Generator-based IR interpreter with cooperative yielding — a tight `while(true)` cannot freeze the tab (`src/runtime/`)
- ✅ Unified virtual clock: `millis()` and `delay()` share one injected clock; deterministic and headless in Node (ADR-0005)
- ✅ IR → Arduino C printer with beginner `pinMode` inference (`src/arduino/`)
- ✅ Runtime tests 1–16 + printer golden tests (`npm test`), driven by synthetic clock/frame schedulers

Phase 1 — learning-loop MVP (in progress):
- ✅ **The editor now runs the honest pipeline**: Blocks → IR → { C preview | IR simulator }. The old
  mock compile (a hard-coded blink hex that ignored your blocks) is gone — Run executes *your* program.
- ✅ Blocks→IR lowering (`src/editor/`) as a pure, tested function of the Blockly JSON
- ✅ Default starter project (Blink) — students never open onto a blank canvas
- ✅ Local-first persistence: debounced LocalStorage autosave, reload restore,
  `.pinboard.json` export/import with Zod boundary validation (`src/persistence/`)
- ✅ Board diagnostics in the hardware panel: non-PWM `analogWrite`, D0/D1 serial pins,
  timer conflicts, analog-read errors, no-loop / no-output hints (`src/hardware/diagnostics.ts`)
- ✅ CI: typecheck + lint + unit tests, and an arduino-cli job that compiles every canonical
  fixture generated from IR (`.github/workflows/`)
- ✅ **Dynamic component system**: add/remove LED, Button, Potentiometer instances; board-aware
  pin picker (capability + availability + used-by context per pin); component blocks
  (`turn LED on`, `is pressed?`, `read pot`) that lower through instance config —
  active-low LEDs emit opposite writes, button pull mode decides the pressed comparison
- ✅ Component-binding diagnostics: pin conflicts, unconnected components, and the
  "your program writes D13 but nothing is connected" teaching warning
- ✅ Starter project ships with hardware pre-added (LED on D13, Button on D2)
- ✅ First two lessons drafted (content before engine): Blink, Button Controls LED (`src/lessons/content/`)
- ✅ **Lesson panel + checks**: pick a lesson, follow steps, press "Check my work" —
  checks inspect the project document, the IR, and a headless simulation trace
  ("the LED really blinks"), never the generated code text; progress persists
  into the project document (`src/lessons/`)
- ⏳ Next: variables/logic/math block library, CodeMirror preview with line↔block
  mapping, buzzer & servo components
